# Farm Fight
 
Farm Fight is a 3D first-person zombie runner set on a low-poly farm at night. This game is created with Unity and C# using assets from the asset store. 

## Game Overview

Farm Fight is a "Zombie Runner" type game set on a low-polygon farm at night. This is a 3-D first person game that will be available on the web, and later on mobile 
(Android and iOS) and Windows desktop. This is a fast paced game combining farming/harvesting and zombie first person battle. 

This game is intended to be playable by anyone who is not afraid of zombie runner type games or animated "zombie-scarecrows." There is no blood or gore and it is suitable for children.

## Game Mechanics

The Zombie scarecrows will spawn in waves from the
Scarecrows in the field. Farmer brown (player) can pickup weapons, health, and vegetables while fighting off the zombies and protecting his crops. Each level will likely have
a different farm or section of the farm with a different layout of zombie and item spawn points. The levels will increase in difficulty (more zombies and fewer pickups) as the game progresses.
The player wins when they make it to the last level. Points are earned when the player defeats zombie scarecrows and harvests vegetables and fruits.

## Features

Some of the below features will be implemented on initial release, others will be added later as this project grows in complexity.

### Pickups (future release)

* Health pickups
* Weapons (gun for now, maybe melee weapons in the future or the ability to throw food or drive a vehicle)
* Vegetables and fruit to harvest

### Enemy AI

The enemy characters will target and hunt down the player if the player is nearby, otherwise they will change behavior and start to destroy the farm.

### Multiplayer (future release)

Possibly add multi-player (online) at a later date. This will likely just be in a WebGL build.

### Player user database (future release)

A database for login authentication and storing player data.

## Story

Daytime on the farm is always busy. Farmer Brown has been working hard all day and is looking forward to getting some sleep. However, a curse has animated the scarecrows, turning them into mindless zombies.
Farmer Brown must defend himself and his crops from the zombies, and harvest as many vegetables and fruits as he can before the zombies eat them (mistaking them for brains, of course).

## Art & Visuals

I am mainly using the assets from the polygon farm low poly 3d art pack by Synty from the unity asset store. 
Here is an overall feel for the characters. I will replace this with screenshots later.

GUI and scene shots will go here shortly.
